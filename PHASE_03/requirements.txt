# For advanced installations (optional):
# If you want the full transformer experience:
# pip install transformers torch ultralytics

# For GPU support (if you have CUDA-compatible GPU):
# pip install tensorflow-gpu

# Installation notes:
# 1. Create virtual environment first: python -m venv venv
# 2. Activate: source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
# 3. Install: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 4. For M1/M2 Macs, you may need: pip install tensorflow-macos tensorflow-metal
