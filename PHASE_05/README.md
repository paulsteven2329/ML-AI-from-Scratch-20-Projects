# PHASE 05: MLOps & Deployment

## 🎯 Goal: Show you're job-ready, not just a model builder

This phase focuses on the critical skills needed to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production environments. You'll learn the engineering aspects of ML that make the difference between academic projects and real-world solutions.

## Projects Overview

### 1️⃣7️⃣ **Model Deployment** 
📁 [model_deployment/](model_deployment/)
- **Project**: Deploy ML Model with FastAPI + Docker
- **Key Concepts**: APIs, Dockerization, Model serving
- **Post Angle**: "A model isn't useful until it's deployed."

### 1️⃣8️⃣ **ML Pipelines**
📁 [ml_pipelines/](ml_pipelines/)
- **Project**: End-to-End ML Pipeline
- **Key Concepts**: Data ingestion, Training pipelines, Automation
- **Post Angle**: "Production ML is 80% engineering."

### 1️⃣9️⃣ **Monitoring & Drift Detection**
📁 [monitoring_drift_detection/](monitoring_drift_detection/)
- **Project**: Detect Data & Concept Drift
- **Key Concepts**: Model decay, Monitoring metrics, Performance tracking
- **Post Angle**: "Why ML models fail silently in production."

### 2️⃣0️⃣ **Capstone AI Product**
📁 [capstone_ai_product/](capstone_ai_product/)
- **Project**: Full AI SaaS App
- **Examples**: AI Interview Coach, Smart Recommendation System, AI Tutor
- **Post Angle**: "From data to deployed AI product."

## 🔧 Technical Skills Covered

- **DevOps for ML**: Docker, containerization, CI/CD
- **API Development**: FastAPI, REST APIs, model serving
- **Pipeline Engineering**: Data ingestion, automated training
- **Production Monitoring**: Drift detection, performance metrics
- **Full-Stack Development**: End-to-end AI applications

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Complete PHASE_01-04 or have equivalent ML knowledge
2. **Setup**: Install requirements and dependencies
3. **Follow Projects**: Work through each project sequentially
4. **Deploy & Share**: Deploy your final capstone project

## 📊 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this phase, you'll be able to:
- Deploy ML models as production-ready APIs
- Build automated ML training and deployment pipelines
- Monitor model performance and detect drift
- Create complete AI-powered applications
- Present yourself as a production-ready ML engineer

## 🔗 LinkedIn Posting Strategy

Each project should include:
- 🔹 Problem statement
- 🔹 Concepts learned
- 🔹 Results & visuals
- 🔹 GitHub link
- 🔹 Key learnings

**Example CTA**: "This is Project X/20 in my ML & AI journey. Follow to see the full series."
